## About

Hi! I'm Channing, a freelance full-stack web app developer based in Boulder, CO. I love learning new things (currently infatuated with Arduinos), creating simple + durable software, adventuresome experiences of all types, pushing the limits of my mind and body, and dancing fearlessly.

    Contracting is a rad way to pay the bills while traveling, but I'm settled in Boulder now and looking for a team that shares my passion for improving the world and building beautiful products. If you have a position that might be a good fit, please reach out to me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cchanningallen">LinkedIn</a> or directly at {% include email.html %}
